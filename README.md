# Future corrections that can be made

This application is not completed nor perfect, hence the following future work can be considered:

- Strict followed Design System convention components developed for reusability and consistency.
- Integrating and importing SVG icons as TypeScript components instead of inline integration.
- Using props for component's conditional rendering
- Using manual or use of validation packages for data validation of forms in frontend as well as backend.
- The app can be made more responsive
- The Signup/ Signin experience can be made seemless with better UX
